`DS-ML-DL-NLP-BOOTCAMP`

`Day 1`
 - Installed `Anaconda` and `vs code` and setup that  
 
 - Creating a `virtual enviroment` via anaconda using powershell
   `conda create -p venv pyhton==3.10`

 - `requirements.txt` - It's a file where we write the names of python libraries our project needs 

 - then we cativate our enviroment via  `conda activate venv/`

 - then instaed of installing individual libraries we can can do `pip install -r requirements.txt`

 - we can make file like `test.py` or `test.ipynb`
   - `test.py` is python file can be executed like `python test.py`
   - `test.ipynb` is a jupiter notebook file so we need to install `pip install ipykernel` on command prompt so we have file like jupiter notebook.
